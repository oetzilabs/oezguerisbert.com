With 15+ years in software engineering, I specialize in TypeScript, learned a bunch in school about Java, wrote a ton in PHP. Adept at organizing projects and fostering team collaboration, I bring creativity and a commitment to continuous learning. Known for delivering cutting-edge solutions, I excel in both large-scale and agile environments.
