As a software engineer with over 15 years of experience, I have wrote projects in *Java*, *PHP*, and mainly **TypeScript**. My experience spans across many projects, including large-scale applications and smaller, more agile projects.

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to keep projects organized and on track. I understand the importance of clear communication and collaboration, and I always strive to maintain a strong working relationship with a team. This includes keeping everyone on the same page, providing regular updates, and proactively addressing potential roadblocks.

In addition to my organizational skills, I bring a high level of <span class="text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-br from-teal-400 to-blue-500 font-bold">creativity</span> to my work. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to contribute with solutions, and I am not afraid to take risks or experiment with new technologies, given the requirements. This has allowed me to consistently deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of the clients or companies.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to continuous learning and development. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills, whether it's through participating in online communities, or experimenting with new tools and frameworks. This dedication to self-improvement has helped me stay at the forefront of the industry and deliver cutting-edge solutions to my clients.

Overall, I am a highly skilled and experienced software engineer who is committed to delivering exceptional results. Whether working on a large-scale project or a smaller, more agile team, I am confident in my ability to keep projects on track and deliver solutions that exceed expectations.
