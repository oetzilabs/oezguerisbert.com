Twitch, a live-stream plattform, has many categories including [Software And Game Development](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Software%20and%20Game%20Development) where many people like me are coding different projects and chat with their audience.

I have my account since a couple years, and streamed very sparodically, but lately I have been coding more and more, streaming my journey. I might have like 1-2 viewers, which already is bonkers ðŸ¤¯ to me. Thanks for those who tune in! I am muted mostly on my streams, since I stream early in the mornings, where my dad is sleeping next room.

## Why Twitch?

Well, mostly because I don't have to set up much to share my journey to people. Why not stream over at YouTube or other platforms? I feel more at home [over at Twitch](https://twitch.tv/oetziofficial), than on YouTube! Other platforms do not interest me at all, even though I have made my accounts there, just in case.

## What projects are been worked on?

Pretty simple. Mostly it's hobby projects, since I am unemployed. I work on a couple SaaS projects, but currently I am working on **Event-Planning Platform (Plaaaner)**.

The tech stack is simple:

-   SST (AWS CDK)
-   PostgreSQL (NeonDatabase)
-   SolidStart (1.0.0-rc.0)
-   TanStack Solid
-   SolidJS
-   Solid Primitives
-   Leaflet
-   Lucia Auth (Oslo, Lucia)
-   DrizzleORM

...(probably more)

I will try to update the current project as much as I can. I just don't have to forget to chagne the blog ðŸ˜….

## Where can I watch past streams?

Well, for that I create playlists over on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OetziOfficial/playlists), where I just export the stream to! The VODs don't have music. Feel free to subscribe, ask questions and anything related to the projects i the comments of the videos! I will try to read and answer them, if needed.
