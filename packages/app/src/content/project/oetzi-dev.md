Welcome to `oetzi.dev`, where I share my latest project ideas, prototypes, and experimental projects. This site is a place for innovation, where I develop and validate concepts to see what could turn into something impactful.

I have a variety of ideas, each of which begins as a rough concept that I refine and explore. Some projects take off immediately, while others undergo rounds of validation and iteration on paper before I commit fully.

I'll be updating this page as my prototypes and projects take shape and become shareable. For now, each project is still in active development, so stay tuned for what's next.
