      <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Özgür Isbert, a dedicated software developer currently based in Germany, with experience working across
        Germany and Switzerland. I’m passionate about creating powerful digital solutions and enjoy diving into complex
        projects, from full-stack applications to system architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary expertise lies in TypeScript for both front-end and back-end development, though I regularly explore
        various languages and frameworks to stay ahead in tech. I'm particularly drawn to new tools and methodologies,
        making experimentation and continuous learning a core part of my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        From frontend and backend development to cloud deployments, I’ve gained strong experience through self-driven
        learning and a formal apprenticeship as a software engineer. My goal is to leave a meaningful impact on the tech
        landscape while contributing to the community.
