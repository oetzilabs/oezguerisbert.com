      <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Page</h1>
      <h2>My name is Özgür Isbert</h2>
      <p>
        I am a software developer from Germany. I am interested in web development, full stack. I started with the age
        of 12, when I created my first website with HTML and CSS. Since then I have been learning new technologies and
        programming languages. I am currently looking for work as a software developer. If you are interested in my work
        or have any questions, please <a href="mailto:oezguerisbert@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on a project called <a href="https://oetzi.dev">oetzi.dev</a>. It is a platform for me to
        play around with new technologies and to learn new things. It is also a place where I can share my knowledge
        with others. I am planning to write blog posts about my projects and other things I am interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to know what projects I am working on, you can check out my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sometimes write blogs about my projects and other things I am interested in. You can find them on my <a
          href="/blogs">blogs</a
        > page. I am also planning to write more blogs in the future.
